/**
 *
 * Polymorphism
 * Polymorphism makes it possible to use the same code structure in different forms.
 * In Java, this means that you can declare several methods with the same name as long as they are different
 * in certain characteristics.
 *
 * As mentioned above, Java provides two ways to implement polymorphism: method overloading and method overriding.
 *
 * Static polymorphism (method overloading)
 * Method overloading means that you can have several methods with the same name within a class. However,
 * the number, names, or types of their parameters need to be different.
